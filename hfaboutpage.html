            <p class="mb-3 p-3">At Herb & Fire we pride ourselves on growing the best quality cannabis using all natural and  organic products and soils. We believe the best experience starts with high quality ingredients, and careful cultivation.</p>
                        
            <p class="mb-3 p-3">As long-time cannabis connoisseurs, we quickly grew impatient with the rapidly increasing prices and inconsistent quality of the cannabis available in our local market. So, once our “state” (D.C.) legalized at-home cannabis cultivation, we didn’t waste any time diving into the community and learning as much as possible about growing. We attended conferences, watched hours and hours of YouTube videos, and finally learned enough to be successful in our first harvest! We haven’t stopped growing or learning since.</p> 
            
            <p class="mb-3 p-3">Since we began in 2020, we have been able to ensure our own consistent access to high quality cannabis. Doing so has put us in the driving seat of our experiences, and significantly improved our quality of life. We tell everyone that we only wished we would have started sooner!</p>
            
            <p class="mb-3 p-3">Nonetheless, we persist and have put this website together to memorialize our progress. As new growers with no real gardening background or experience, we hope that something here resonates or inspires you to start your own grow (if you can do so legally). You can check out our photos <a href="/hfphotos.html">here</a>!</p>
        
            <p class="mb-3 p-3">Also, if you’re in the D.C. or Virginia area, and would love to connect, please feel free to reach out via our <a href=hfcontactus.html>contact us</a> page to share tips, methods, photos and more!</p>
